I have attached all the GO files and the presentation in pptx form. But, while downloading the ppt from Canva to pptx form, some images were off the frame for some reason. So, I will recommend using [this Canva link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGiwwuxlig/WHN6aHL2r2Gxy0CWrkdewQ/edit?utm_content=DAGiwwuxlig&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) instead to access the presentation.
